# Symmetrical cryptography repository
The repository contains (in the future) 4 laboratory works:
1. Analysis of the text and calculation of its numerical properties - entropy per character, entropy per bigram and language redundancy  
2. Analysis of the Vigen√®re cipher and its cracking using the index of Coincedence
3. Analysis of an affine cipher over bigrams and its cracking using frequency analysis
